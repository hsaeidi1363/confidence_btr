 *  @brief This findNearestPoint.h is a header file of finding
 *   the closest point on a post smoothing surface. There are three method in this class.
 *   The goal is to get indices array which indicate the closest point with several given points.
 *   For example, I can given a arbitrary coordinate and use this class to
 *   find a closest point ID from point cloud group.
