  /*
   * The method works by maintaining a list of points from which the mesh can be
   * grown (“fringe” points) and extending it until all possible points are connected.
   * It can deal with unorganized points, coming from one or multiple scans, and having
   * multiple connected parts. It works best if the surface is locally smooth and there
   * are smooth transitions between areas with different point densities.
   *
   * Triangulation is performed locally, by projecting the local neighborhood of a point
   * along the point’s normal, and connecting unconnected points. Thus, the following parameters
   * can be set:
   *
   * 1. setMaximumNearestNeighbors(unsigned) and setMu(double) control the size of the neighborhood.
   * The former defines how many neighbors are searched for, while the latter specifies the maximum
   * acceptable distance for a point to be considered, relative to the distance of the nearest point
   * (in order to adjust to changing densities). Typical values are 50-100 and 2.5-3 (or 1.5 for grids).
   *
   * 2. setSearchRadius(double) is practically the maximum edge length for every triangle. This has
   * to be set by the user such that to allow for the biggest triangles that should be possible.
   *
   * 3. setMinimumAngle(double) and setMaximumAngle(double) are the minimum and maximum angles
   * in each triangle. While the first is not guaranteed, the second is. Typical values are 10
   * and 120 degrees (in radians).
   *
   * 4.setMaximumSurfaceAgle(double) and setNormalConsistency(bool) are meant to deal with
   * the cases where there are sharp edges or corners and where two sides of a surface run very
   * close to each other. To achieve this, points are not connected to the current point if their
   * normals deviate more than the specified angle (note that most surface normal estimation methods
   * produce smooth transitions between normal angles even at sharp edges). This angle is computed
   * as the angle between the lines defined by the normals (disregarding the normal’s direction)
   * if the normal-consistency-flag is not set, as not all normal estimation methods can guarantee
   * consistently oriented normals. Typically, 45 degrees (in radians) and false works on most datasets.
